Today I learned how to use the Makera software the create a PCB board. In the beginning, I was given a slideshow that showed us how to create the tool path. Then I created a workflow from the slideshow. After that, I went to the lab and was shown how to upload the G-code and begin the milling process.



Troubles: My first board didn't mill all the way through, so I changed the height dimension to 1.7mm. Because I had to change the dimensions, I had to restart the design process. The next time I went to the mill, I saw that one of the screws on the rig was unscrewed when it wasn't supposed to be. I then paused the machine by clicking the pause current G-code task. The machine then turned itself off and would not turn back on. Therefore, I didn't have time to finish milling the board.
