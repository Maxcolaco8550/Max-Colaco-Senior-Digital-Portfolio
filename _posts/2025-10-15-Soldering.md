Day 1: Today, I opened the pack and organized the pieces. I soldered 5 resistors on R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5. I also soldered the chip onto U1 and another chip onto U2. In addition, 1 monolithic  capacitor in.

Day 2: I accidentally dropped my capacitors. I found them and then soldered the monolithic capacitors into C2 and C3. After I soldered on the Transitors on Q1 and Q2. I also soldered the Electrolytic Capacitor to C1.

Day 3: Today I soldered the USBC direct plug and began soldering my LEDs.

Day 4: I began to solder the LEDs again but I realized that the first row on the right were on the wrong side of the board so I used a solder sucker to remove them. I then began to finish the LEDs. I only had 10 left

Day 5: I finished the board today, and it worked. 2 of the holes on the leftmost side of the board couldn’t house LEDs because the solder was blocking the entry, and the last hole had an LED that still managed to work, but due to time constraints, I couldn’t fix it.

**Setbacks**: I had soldered a row of LEDs incorrectly, so I used a solder sucker and removed them and flipped them. Some of the LED legs got stuck, so I was not able to place them back in.


Through this project, I better understood how to solder in addition to using a solder sucker.
