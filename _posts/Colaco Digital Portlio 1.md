Day 1: Today, I found a tutorial for the arcade machine, which was created by maxvfisher. The tutorial will be linked below.


Day 2: I began to create my Bill of Materials. I am using a Google spreadsheet that will track vendor, price, and the name of the part. I also decided to use a 30mm Push Button 3/16".


Day 3: I continued creating my Bill of Materials. Today I  found the joystick I plan to use, which is the EG STARTS 1x Arcade Joystick Classic Competition 5Pin 4-8 Ways Joystick.


Day 4: I got a Raspberry Pi 4B, which will have retropi and will receive inputs from the joystick and the buttons.


Day 5: Today I downloaded Retropi on the Raspberry Pi and continued my Bill of Materials. I realized that I needed hinges for the back of the arcade machine to open and close it. I found SYINE Heavy-Duty Butt Hinge Zinc Alloy, 1.5'' x 1.5''.


Day 6: I opened Retropi on the Raspberry Pi and began to input commands for a keyboard. I also began to familiarize myself with retropi. I have never used RetroPi before, so I found a tutorial on YouTube made by TechHut.


Day 7: I continued to make progress on retropi. In Retropi, I changed the settings to allow for overscan. I also ran into the issue of Retropi when you configure the controls on a keyboard, unless I reboot it. I am going to work on the physical cabinet design in Fusion 360 until I have the buttons and the joystick.


Day 8: Today, I worked on creating the side and back panel for the machine in Fusion 360.


Day 9: Today, I continued working on creating the panels. I added the light panel and the panel that will house the buttons and the joystick. I then began to create the stickers for the machine. I made one for the word Move and found the correct font, which was Puffin Arcade on Adobe Illustrator.


Day 10: Today, I continued making the panels. I made a door for the back panel so the electronics could be accessed easily. I also began to plan out how I am going to make the


Day 11: Today, I created a slot for RGB lights in the side Panels. I used 4.85mm x 720mm. A .05mm gap was created between the RGB measurement and the gap to ensure that when the CNC machine cuts the wood, the lights will easily fall into place.
