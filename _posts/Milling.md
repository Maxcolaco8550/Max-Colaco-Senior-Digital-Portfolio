Today I learned how to use the Makera software the create a PCB board. In the beginning I were given a slideshow that showed us how to create the tool path. Then I created a workflow off of the slideshow. After that I went to the lab and was shown how to upload the gcode and begin the milling process. 

Troubles:
My first board didn't mill all the way through so I changed the height dimension to 1.7mm. Because I had to change the dimensions I had to restart the design process. The next time I went to mill I saw that one of the screws on the rig was unscrewed when it wasn't supposed to be. I then pasued the machine by clicking the pause current gcode task. The machine then turned itself off and would not turn back on. Therefore I didn't have time to finish milling the board.
