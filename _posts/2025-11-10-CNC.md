**Journal**

Day 1: I was given a slideshow that demonstrated how to create the tool path. Then I created a workflow from the slideshow.


Day 2: I finished the board today and then went to the lab and was shown how to upload the G-code and begin the milling process. The board took about 5 hours to complete, so I grabbed the board the following day

Failed board

Day 3: The board didn't mill all the way through, so I had to change the height to 1.7mm. I then restarted the process, but as I clicked the button to begin the job, I saw there was a screw in the rig that was not tightened, so I clicked the "pause current G-code task" button on the bottom left of the software. The machine then turned itself off and wouldn't turn back on.

This a screesnhot of the design software


**Troubles**: 
My first board didn't mill all the way through, so I changed the height dimension to 1.7mm. Because I had to change the dimensions, I had to restart the design process. The next time I went to the mill, I saw that one of the screws on the rig was unscrewed when it wasn't supposed to be. I then paused the machine by clicking the pause current G-code task. The machine then turned itself off and would not turn back on. Therefore, I didn't have time to finish milling the board.


Below are screenshots of the final mountain milling desing in Aspire

**Reflection**
Throughout this project, I learned how to design a PCB board and mill a board using the Makera software. I learned that when creating a PCB, I need to center the board by clicking this design, then clicking my mouse to move the board to the far left corner. After moving, also make sure that the software knows where the origin is by using the quick align feature.

I was reminded through this project that KiCad files are transported through 3 types of files: edge cuts, F_Cu, and PTH. These files each refer to a different cut the machine is executing. The edge cuts are used for cutting out the border of the board. The PTH is for the holes in the board, and the F_Cu is for cutting the traces.

Finally, I also learned how, when you are using the machine, you only unscrew the screws that are the closest on the inside, because if not, you will loosen the jig. It was set up previously by a teacher, so I just needed to unscrew 6 screws and slide the board in and rescrew them to ensure the board was in place.
