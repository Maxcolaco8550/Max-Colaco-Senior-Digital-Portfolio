## Week 1 
- Today, I found a tutorial for the arcade machine, which was created by maxvfisher. The tutorial will be linked below.

- I began to create my Bill of Materials. I am using a Google spreadsheet that will track vendor, price, and the name of the part. I also decided to use a 30mm Push Button 3/16".


 - I continued creating my Bill of Materials. Today I  found the joystick I plan to use, which is the EG STARTS 1x Arcade Joystick Classic Competition 5Pin 4-8 Ways Joystick.


- I got a Raspberry Pi 4B, which will have retropi and will receive inputs from the joystick and the buttons.


 - Today I downloaded Retropi on the Raspberry Pi and continued my Bill of Materials. I realized that I needed hinges for the back of the arcade machine to open and close it. I found SYINE Heavy-Duty Butt Hinge Zinc Alloy, 1.5'' x 1.5''.


- I opened Retropi on the Raspberry Pi and began to input commands for a keyboard. I also began to familiarize myself with retropi. I have never used RetroPi before, so I found a tutorial on YouTube made by TechHut.


 - I continued to make progress on retropi. In Retropi, I changed the settings to allow for overscan. I also ran into the issue of Retropi when you configure the controls on a keyboard, unless I reboot it. I am going to work on the physical cabinet design in Fusion 360 until I have the buttons and the joystick.

## Week 2 
- Today, I worked on creating the side and back panel for the machine in Fusion 360.

- Today, I continued working on creating the panels. I added the light panel and the panel that will house the buttons and the joystick. I then began to create the stickers for the machine. I made one for the word Move and found the correct font, which was Puffin Arcade on Adobe Illustrator.

- Today, I continued making the panels. I made a door for the back panel so the electronics could be accessed easily. I also began to plan out how I am going to make the

- Today, I created a slot for RGB lights in the side Panels. I used 4.85mm x 720mm. A .05mm gap was created between the RGB measurement and the gap to ensure that when the CNC machine cuts the wood, the lights will easily fall into place.

## Week 3 
During this week, I switched my focus back to the Raspberry Pi. For the majority of the week, I was doing research on how to get the games I wanted onto the RetroPi software. I learned that I needed to download ROMs, which stand for Read Only Memory, which in this case holds a game and its code. I had never heard of ROMs, so I did a lot of research on where to obtain a free version. I found a website called MAME, which offers free ROMs and is considered a safe platform for downloading them. After I found this website, I found a tutorial on how to download them and get them onto the Raspberry Pi. I needed a thumb drive to transfer the ROMs over. I didn't get a thumb drive until the next week. I then went to download the ROMs at school, but the wifi blocked it, so I needed to do it at home. I switched my attention to the fusion files. I continued to work on the button panel, changing the number of buttons from the original. The original had 16 buttons, and I decreased it to 8, 4 for one side and 4 for the other. That was all I managed for this week.

## Week 4 ##
During this week I had less time to work on our personal project because I was working on the topography map. I did realzie that my dimensions for the cabinet were off though. I forgot that I got an old tv earlier in the year and planned to use that instead of a computer monitor like the original design. I needed to switch all of the dimensions. I first started with the Button Panel soand extended it by 200mm on horizontally and vertically. I also changed the dimensions of the main panel that held the screen. I realized that the sides were too skinny to hold the tv because it weighed more than a monitor. This is where I ended for the week.
