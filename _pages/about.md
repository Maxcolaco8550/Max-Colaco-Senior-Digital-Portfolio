Today I learned how to use the Makera software the create a PCB board. In the beginning I were given a slideshow that showed us how to create the tool path. Then I created a workflow off of the slideshow. After that I went to the lab and was shown how to upload the gcode and begin the milling process. 

Troubles:
My first board didn't mill all the way through so I changed the dimensions to 1.7mm for the height.
