# Description #
This project entailed creating a topography map of a specific mountain of our choosing, creating it in aspire, then cncing the file. We used a 2.5x 3 x 1 inch block of pine wood. The mountain range that I chose was Park Range near Mt. Werner in Steamboat Springs, Colorado.At the beginning of this project we used a free software online called Terrain2STL to get the desired mountain range. We then genreated a model off of that website and sent it into Aspire to then manipulate the design to portray the mountain range's height and eccentuate the detail. For the design phase of this project we were following a workflow designed by Dr. Taylor one of the engineering teachers at the school. The main deviation from the workflow that I did was that I cut off the bottom of the block in aspire and eccentuated the height and defintion of mountain range.
