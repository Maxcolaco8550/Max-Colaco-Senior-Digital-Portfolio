# Description #
This project entailed creating a topography map of a specific mountain of our choosing, creating it in Aspire, then cncing the file. We used a 2.5x 3 x 1-inch block of pine wood. The mountain range that I chose was the Park Range near Mt. Werner in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. At the beginning of this project, we used a free software online called Terrain2STL to get the desired mountain range. We then generated a model from that website and sent it into Aspire to then manipulate the design to portray the mountain range's height and accentuate the detail. For the design phase of this project, we were following a workflow designed by Dr. Taylor, one of the engineering teachers at the school. The main deviation from the workflow that I did was that I cut off the bottom of the block in Aspire and accentuated the height and definition of the mountain range.

## Problems ##
During the project, I did not encounter any problems. When I finished the CNC job, the mountain had a layer around it on the outside, so I used a bandsaw on the outside edges to make the mountain clearer. After I used the bansaw I sanded down all of the edges.
